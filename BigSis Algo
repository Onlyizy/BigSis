First time the app runs:
  Write Log File with version date time location
  Initialize runmode variable
  Ask the user for the runmode advanced version or minimal:
    If advanced:
      then downloads required libraries.
      pass "advanced" in runmode var
      write runmode in next log for next use
    Elif minimal:
      pass "minimal" in runmode var
      write runmode in log for next use
      
  Initialize Rnum
  Initialize Rlist
  Initialize Clist
  Initialize Cnum
  #The reason for initializing all this is to minimize errors during runtime
  Ask user for number of roommates(Rnum)
  For i in range(len(Rnum)):
    Ask pseudonyme (Add Privacy disclaimer) and append to Rlist:
  Ask user for number of chores (Cnum):
  For i in range(len(Cnum)):
    Ask for Chore and append to Clist
  Write data in log for future use.
  If runmode advanced:
      Verify if required libraries are present
      If not:
        Download them.                #Redunduncy remove if possible
      Else:
      ???                             #not done yet
   Elif runmode minimal: 
    initialize taskdispatch dict
    initialize empty nodes
      for name in Rlist:
        name=Node(name)
        nodes.append(name)
      for node in nodes:
        if node==nodes[-1]:
          node.nextval=nodes[0]
        else:
          node.nextval=nodes[nodes.index(node)+1]
      for chore in Clist:
        tmpNode=nodes[0]
        if no chores assigned at tmpNode key:
          dispatcher.setdefault(tmpNode.val,chore)
        else:
          dispatcher @ tmpNode key is updated with a list where chore is appended.
        at the end tmpNode.nextval overwrites tmpNode
        
   #Now we have to take care of the personal chore tracker which will be a Stack Object
   initialize tasktracker dict
   for 

    else:
  
  Tell the user the app will restart.
  
Every other time the app runs:
  Read Log file:
    If runmode advanced:
      Verify if required libraries are present
      If not:
        Download them.
      Else:
      ???
   Elif runmode minimal:
    Retreive roomate list and chores:
    For i in range(len(Rlist[:len(Rlist)-1])):
      mate=Node(Rlist[i],Rlist[i+1])              #Node Object
      
    
    For chore in Clist:
      tracker=stack(Rlist)
