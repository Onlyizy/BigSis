# BigSis
BigSis is a python program helping roomates to organize chores. 
At the moment of writing this the script is only written in python3 planning to create a *web based* GUI later on.
The idea is to make use of stack objects and different basic datastrucure to create a simple way for saavy roommates to organize the chores.
